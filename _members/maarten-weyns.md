After obtaining his MSc degree, Maarten continues his research into botnets in a PhD position in the Cyber Security group at the TU Delft. The research covers several topics, including malware analysis, monitoring live botnet activity, analyzing attack targets and investigating used attack tactics. The research is performed under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Georgios Smaragdakis and Dr. Harm Griffioen.

Leading up to his PhD position, Maarten completed his BSc and MSc in Computer Science at the TU Delft. His MSc thesis explored the “Gorilla” DDoS botnet, which laid the groundwork for his current research.

Next to his studies, Maarten was actively involved in several committees of the W.I.S.V. ‘Christiaan Huygens’ study association. Among these, he worked on organizing international ICPC algorithmic programming competitions in Delft.
