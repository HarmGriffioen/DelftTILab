I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Cybersecurity (CYS) research group at TU Delft, working under the supervision of Professor Georgios Smaragdakis and Professor Harm Griffioen. I will be working on a broad spectrum of cybersecurity topics, including:

- Network Security
- Internet Measurement
- Malware Analysis
- Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

My primary focus involves leveraging TU Delft's Network Telescopes and Honeypots to understand internet wide scanning activities and their implications on our cybersecurity.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at TU Delft, specializing in Cybersecurity. My master's thesis examined the proliferation of Mirai botnets and their variants, laying the groundwork for my current research interests.
